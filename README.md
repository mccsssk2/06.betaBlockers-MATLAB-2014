# 06.betaBlockers-MATLAB-2014  

Matlab based cardiac simulator. Provided in this repo is the 2D solver that uses ode15s for implicit reaction solution,
and a TDMA solver for a stable solution of the PDE. Data processing in terms of arrhythmia initiation (using phase method),
tracking (filament tracking), and other metrics were inspired by VNB and literature. The code was generated using CellML and OpenCOR in MATLAB for rapid
development/prototyping. Since this work was completed, all functionality has been assimilated into my VCPL cardiac simulator package.
